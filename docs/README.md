## Flexbugs Static Files

This folder primarily houses static html files containing [bugs and their workarounds](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#the-bugs-and-their-workarounds) for hosting on GitHub pages. You can view their source code in this folder [here](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs/tree/master/docs).

In order to ensure that the original documentation stays on GitHub [README](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#flexbugs) (and not on GitHub pages), absolute links have been used (instead of relative links) wherever applicable.
